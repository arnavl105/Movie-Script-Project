We tried to look for patterns in the line breaks and character names but all we could find was that character names were generally in all caps. Unfortunately, so were other aspects of the script. After a lot of frustration and failed attempts we realized that in the original html files for the movie scripts, character names were always bolded (meaning that they were surrounded by a &#60;b&#62; tag). From that realization we changed our scraping code to download the scripts with the original html tags intact and then use python string parsing to isolate the characters and dialogue."

In old theaters two projectors are used so someone has to change projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel begins.  Sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand corner...\n",
      "TYLER They're called \"cigarette burns.\"\n",
      "JACK It's called a \"changeover.\"  The movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea.\n",
      "TYLER Why would anyone want this shitty job?\n",
      "JACK It affords him other interesting opportunities.\n",
      "TYLER -- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.\n",
      "JACK In reel three right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...\n",
      "TYLER One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.\n",
      "JACK No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.\n",

      "JACK He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and with creme of mushroom soup well...\n",
      "TYLER (O.S.) Go ahead.  Say it.\n",
      "JACK You get the idea.\n",
      "JACK I don't know about this.\n",
      "TYLER I don't know either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit have you?\n",
      "JACK No.  That's a good thing isn't it?\n",

      "JACK I know that.\n",

      "JACK (V.O.) I don't know how Tyler found the house but he'd been there for half a year.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.  Most of the windows were boarded up.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) None of the doors locked.  The stairs were ready to collapse.  I didn't know if he owned it or he was squatting.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) Neither would have surprised me.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing leaked.  Turning on a light meant another light in the house went out.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) There were no neighbors.  Just warehouses and the paper mill.  The fart smell of steam the hamster cage smell of wood chips.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) At night Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) When it rained we had to kill the power.  By the end of the first month I didn't care about TV.  I didn't mind the warm stale refrigerator.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.\n",

      "JACK (V.O.) But I wasn't.\n",

      "TYLER Welcome to fight club.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) Every week Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.\n",
      "TYLER The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.  The second rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.  The third rule of fight club is -- when someone says \"stop\" or goes limp the fight is over.  Fourth rule is -- only two guys to a fight.  Fifth rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth rule -- no shirts no shoes.  Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to.  And the eighth and final rule -- if this is your first night at fight club you have to fight.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) This kid Ricky -- supply clerk -- couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink ...\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) But Ricky was a god for ten minutes last week when he trounced an actuary twice his size.\n",

      "JACK (V.O.) Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight I wouldn't be talking to the same man.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.  But fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club starts and when fight club ends.\n",
      "BOSS What are you getting yourself into every week?\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) After fight club everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.\n",
      "BOSS Have you finished those reports?\n",
      "JACK Yes.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) The people who had power over you have less and less.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) By this point I could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw.\n",
      "JACK (V.O.) A guy came to fight club for the first time his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks he was carved out of wood.\n",

    "The first thing that stood out to us as we analyzed the data was that men had siginificantly more dialogue than women. The total number of lines for men was 121,262 while women only had 42,151 lines. After running a feature extraction on the data we found the words with the highest correlation to men included stop words, masculine words, words about fighting, religious words, and all of the curse words. The words with the highest correlation to women included words about the self (me, I), relationship words (husband, honey), loving words, and the word 'please.' We thought it was interesting to note the potential sexism in these words- and the correlation with typically male/female concepts appearing in the dataset."

This model had a 74% accuracy, however, we feel this may have been somewhat skewed by the difference in volume between male and female dialogue. In fact, the model was the most accurate when predicting male dialogue. When we provided 10 famous speeches as test data (where 5 of the speeches were male and 5 were female), the model predicted that all the speeches were male, getting only 50% correct. We were disappointed in these results but understood how they could be obtained given a dataset so heavily skewed towards men."

Once again, we used correlation to find the most prominent features and found that amongst the 0-18 year old characters family titles like <b>daddy, dad, mom, mommy, auntie,</b> and <b>uncle</b> were the most highly correlated. Amongst the 18-36 year old bracket we found that slang terms like <b>dude, yo, cool,</b> and <b>shit</b> were highly correlated along with <b>huh, really,</b> and an assortment of first names. The 36-54 and 54-72 age brackets didn't have many explanatory features. It was interesting to note that, for some reason, the 72+ bracket had a lot of star trek terms (such as <b>vulcan, starfleet, warp, enterprise, and klingon</b>). These correlations were significantly weaker than those used when analyzing gender, with the maximum correlation equalling about .05."

   "source": [
    "What stood out the most as we were analyzing our data was how gender stereotypes were very much present in the movie scripts we analyzed. While men were correlated with speech about violence and general hatefulness, women were often correlated with love and relationship words. Even though women may discuss war or violence in a film, there are more cases of women talking about love and relationships, which is a stereotype that separates the genders in an interesting way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was also hard to ignore the massive difference in volume between male and female dialogue. Because of this, we wondered how much this disparity affected our results. In an ideal dataset of 50% male and female dialogue, we wondered whether the correlations we noticed would appear as often. As stated previously, our generated small test set was proposed to have all male dialogue by the model although half of the speeches were given by women. It is possible that the model was 'playing it safe' by choosing the result that would most likely occur given the data, or that the speeches given happened to all use a majority of masculine-leaning words. It would be interesting to supply a large database of speech data as a test set to test this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age tended to be much harder to predict as there only seemed to be significant differences between large gaps in age. While the model predicted the difference between very young and very old people accurately, the ages in the middle had little to no difference (particularly in the 36-72 year range). It is possible that scripts simply do not write characters within these ages differently, as the words with the highest correlation in these categories had little-to-no meaning and very low correlation values (less than .05). Young and old characters did have differences, which makes sense given that these characters often have slightly similar interactions on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have explored this data, there is a lot that could be done to dive deeper into it. It would be very interesting to test other models on the data using a better processor, or to use feature selection in attempt to draw out more interesting correlations from the data (without stop words, for instance). We believe that we have only scratched the surface of the value of this dataset and would love to pass it along to future classes or projects who would have an interest in it."
